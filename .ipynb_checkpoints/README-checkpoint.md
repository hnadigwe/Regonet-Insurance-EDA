# Regonet Insurance EDA Project 🚗📊

This repository contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project on automobile insurance pricing, prepared for the Regonet Challenge. The objective is to derive insights into factors influencing car prices and insurance losses using Python-based data analysis tools.

## 🧠 Project Objective

To analyze automobile features and uncover the most influential factors affecting car price and insurance risk using real-world data.



## 🔍 Key Questions Answered

- What features influence car price the most?
- Do certain brands consistently have higher price points?
- How does risk rating relate to normalized insurance losses?
- Are there trends in fuel type, engine size, and horsepower?



## 📊 Summary of Insights

- **Price Drivers**: Horsepower, engine size, and curb weight are strongly correlated with car prices.
- **Brand Impact**: BMW and Mercedes-Benz dominate the higher-price segment.
- **Risk Indicators**: Higher symboling (risk rating) correlates with increased normalized losses.
- **Fuel Type**: Diesel and gas vehicles show differences in price and performance.
