# Regonet Insurance EDA Project 🚗📊

This repository contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project on automobile insurance pricing, prepared for the Regonet Challenge. The objective is to derive insights into factors influencing car prices and insurance losses using Python-based data analysis tools.

## 🧠 Project Objective

To analyze automobile features and uncover the most influential factors affecting car price and insurance risk using real-world data.



## 🔍 Key Questions Answered

- What features influence car price the most?
- Do certain brands consistently have higher price points?
- How does risk rating relate to normalized insurance losses?
- Are there trends in fuel type, engine size, and horsepower?



## 📊 Summary of Insights

- **Price Drivers**: Horsepower, engine size, and curb weight are strongly correlated with car prices.
- **Brand Impact**: BMW and Mercedes-Benz dominate the higher-price segment.
- **Risk Indicators**: Higher symboling (risk rating) correlates with increased normalized losses.
- **Fuel Type**: Diesel and gas vehicles show differences in price and performance.

# 📎 Appendix A – Glossary of Terms
## Term Definition
### EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) The initial process of analyzing datasets to summarize main characteristics using statistical graphics and plots.
### Correlation A statistical measure that expresses the extent to which two variables are linearly related. Ranges from -1 to 1.
### Heatmap A graphical representation of data where individual values are represented as colors. Used to show correlation matrices.
### One-hot encoding A method of converting categorical variables into binary columns (0s and 1s).
### Feature Engineering The process of creating new input features or modifying existing ones to improve model performance.
### Underwriter A person or company that evaluates the risk of insuring a person or asset and establishes pricing.
### Normalized Losses Adjusted loss values to a common scale, allowing for fairer comparisons across data points.
### Risk-based pricing A pricing strategy where prices are based on the risk profile of the individual or asset.
### Symboling A numerical representation of a car’s risk rating used in insurance pricing.
### Premium The amount paid for insurance coverage.
### Outlier A data point that differs significantly from other observations.
### Scatterplot A type of plot used to show the relationship between two continuous variables.
### GitHub A web-based platform used for version control and collaborative coding projects.
### Medium A publishing platform often used for writing and sharing articles, particularly technical write-ups.¶
